# Markdown Mastery
Markdown is a very simple tech 'language' that is used for writing things from readme's to technical documents, code libraries, wiki's, etc.

It's supported by default on sites like Github, Reddit and many more. Markdown is also fully supported in 'Bear' editor and many other text editors and apps. The learning curve for markdown is very minor. It's easy to learn, yet fairly powerful and allows quick editing and formatting.

It doesn't do anything like change font size, color or the font itself. It's used for general formatting such as bolds, italics, header sizing, paragraph formatting, quotations, lists, etc.
