# Paragraphs & Line Breaks
When we write a line of text - like this - "random stuff goes here". And then want a completely separate line, we must give a FULL space between lines in order to break that next bit of text into a 'paragraph'.

For example:
one
two
three
four

We can see that in the actual markdown file, the words one - four are on their own line, but with no spacing between them, they are not considered a separate line and are therefore put together one one line in the *actual* markdown file.

(The exception to this is directly after a header. In that case, we do not have to provide two line breaks for the next line to be on its own line.)
