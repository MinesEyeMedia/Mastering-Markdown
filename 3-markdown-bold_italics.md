# Bold, Italic & Strikethrough
## Bolding
In markdown, we can use asterisks (```*```) or underscores (```_```) in order to bold or italicize something.

Let's say we want to BOLD the word MARKDOWN.
We can wrap the word, phrase or sentence we want bolded in either double asterisks or underscores.

**MARKDOWN** = = = __MARKDOWN__

## Italicizing

Conversely, by wrapping text in a single asterisk or understore set, we can italicize it.

*ITALICIZE* = = = _ITALICIZE_

NOTE: As mentioned, even though we can use single or double understores or asterisks for this purpose, the **general convention** here is that we use **double asterisks** for bold, and **single underscores** for Italicizing.

## Bolding & Italicizing

If we wanted to both **BOLD** and _ITALICIZE_ a word or sentence, we can accomplish this in two ways.

The first way is to wrap the content in both double asterisks and underscores, as seen below:<br>

**_Bolding & Italicizing this content using asterisks and understores._**

The second, and much simplier and quicker way is to just wrap the content in 3 asterisks, similar to how we create a **horizontal rule/line**.

***Bolding & Italicizing this content using just triple asterisks.***

## Strikethrough

In order to "strikethrough" text, we need to wrap that text in **DOUBlE TILDA'S**. A set of single tilda's will just literally wrap the text with single tilda's.
