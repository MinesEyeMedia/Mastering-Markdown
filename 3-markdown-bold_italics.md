# Bold, Italic & Strikethrough
In markdown, we can use asterisks (```*```) or underscores (```_```) in order to bold or italisize something.

Let's say we want to BOLD the word MARKDOWN.
We can wrap the word, phrase or sentence we want bolded in either double asterisks or underscores.

**MARKDOWN** = = = __MARKDOWN__

Conversely, by wrapping text in a single asterisk or understore set, we can italisize it.

*ITALISIZE* = = = _ITALISIZE_

NOTE: As mentioned, even though we can use single or double understores or asterisks for this purpose, the **general convention** here is that we use **double asterisks** for bold, and **single underscores** for italisizing.

In order to "strikethrough" text, we need to wrap that text in **DOUBlE TILDA'S**. A set of single tilda's will just literally wrap the text with single tilda's.
