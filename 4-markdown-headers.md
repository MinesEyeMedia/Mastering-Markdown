# Headers (Headings)
There are two ways of doing headers/headings in markdown. The simpliest way is to simply use hashes.

One hash for h1, 2 for h2 and so on. The line separator after the h1 is automatically applied. Another nice thing with using hashes for your headers if by using them we will automatically applied ID's to the text of that header and it will allow us to link to them in the case of say a Table of Contents, or any use really.

As mentioned above, there _is_ another way to apply an h1 and h2 header to text, but it's a poorly implemented method and therefore I won't even take the time to explain it, as I'll never use that method.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

And that concludes the heading section.
