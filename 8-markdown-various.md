# Line Breaks, Horizontal Rules & Block Quotes

## Line Breaks
As we know, if we have 3 lines of text all on their own line, as below, they will stack up against each other as if there was no actually line break.

In order for us to break text up and create that line break, we must have a completely separate line between items to declare them as a new paragraph. This is nothing new to me at this point of writing all of the previous markdown notes, but we can also force a line break with a traditional ```<br>``` tag.

Eggs<br>
Chesse<br>
Milk<br>

## Horizontal Rule (Lines)
Horizontal "Rules" or 'Lines' as I call them can be created by tripple asterisks, tripple dashes, or tripple underscores. Personally I'm a fan of using the triple asterisk, but the other options work as well.

## Block Quotes
If we wanted to quote someone from a form post, or whatever reason a person might quote someone, we can simply apply the standard 'blockquote' look by putting a single right-angle bracket before the quote.

> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. - Wayne Gretzky

> Do or do not, there is no try. - Master Yoda

To create a space between lines **within** the block quote, we simply add another right-angle bracket with a blank line. See below:

> These go to eleven! - This is Spinal Tap
>
> The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. - The Usual Suspects
>
> You can't handle the truth! - A Few Good Men

We can also apply other text formatting within blockquotes as you would imagine:
> Yeah, well... that's like... just your ***opinion***, man.<br> - **The Dude** (_The Big Lebowski_)
