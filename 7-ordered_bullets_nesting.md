# Ordered Lists, Unordered Lists, Bullet Lists & Nested Lists

## Ordered Lists
To make an ordered list, we simple just enter in an number, followed by a period (```.```) and space in front of the items we want in the list. You **DO NOT** have to manually write the sequential number into the list.<br>
_For example, you don't need to put 1., 2., 3., in front of each item in the list._

You **could** do this, and it would do no harm, but by simply putting a static single number in front of the list, the markdown language, when parsed, will know that this is an ordered list and automatically apply the proper sequential number.

 This allows items in the list to be added or removed at any point and the list will automatically reconfirgure the items to display the correct numbers.

See below for an ordered list:

### Instructions
1. Retrieve 23mm socket-wrench from box.
2. Remove outer protective housing.
3. Using 23mm socket-wrench, remove the 2 bolts.
4. After successful removal, gentle tap housing.

## Un-Ordered Lists
To make an un-ordered list we can simply insert a single asterisk infront of the item we want in the list, followed by a space.

### Ingredients
* milk
* bread
* cheese
* flour
* salt

## Nested Lists
Nested lists are created very simply in markdown by just tabbing/intending to the depths that you'd like them at and using the above principals.<br>
See below:

### Steps for Activation
1. Remove SIM card from packaging.
    * Be careful not to scratch gold surface.
2. Remove back battery cover from phone.
    * If battery is internal then look for a SIM card ejection port on side or rear of device.
    * If no SIM port can be found, then smash phone on nearest surface until fully destroyed.
3. Carefully insert SIM card into desired SIM slot.
    * Without touching the gold contact, gentle slide the SIM card into the slot or card bay.
        * If fingers come into contact with gold connectors, gentle wipe off with **dry** cloth and re-attempt insertion.
4. Replace battery cover on phone and power up.
5. Verify phone recognizes SIM card.

      * How deep can we go with these nested lists you ask?
        * Deeper than your mom can take it!
          * Iiiiiooooo! haha!
          * Good one, bro!!
          * Lolz...
          * Burn.
